# Definition
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. The visitor pattern lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

# Computer example
It is very useful when plugging happens into public APIs. Clients can then perform operations on a class with a visiting class without modifying the source.
