# Definition
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

# Real-life example
A language translator who translates a language for us provides a classci example for this pattern.

# Computer example
A java compiler interprets the source code into byte code.

# Note
1. It is widely used to interpret the statements in a language as abstract syntax trees. It performs best when the grammar is easy to understand and simple.
2. We can represent, modify, or implement a grammar easily.
3. We can evaluate an expression in our preferred ways.
4. if the grammar is complex, implementing this pattern becomes hard.
